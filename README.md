## Overview
Image captioning is the task of generating textual descriptions for images automatically. This project aims to build an image captioning system using deep learning techniques.

## Pre-stuff
Download the dataset used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dataset/e1cd22253a9b23b073794872bf565648ddbe4f17e7fa9e74766ad3707141adeb). Then set the "images" folder and captions.txt inside a folder called "flickr8k".

Alternative dataset 'coco' [train](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2014.zip) and [validate](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2014.zip)

Alternative [captions](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/caption_datasets.zip) for both (used with coco)

## Good to know
If you want to save the trained model, be sure the set save_model to True in train.py.

## Results
The generated captions are in the results folder, using the pictures in the test_examples folder.
